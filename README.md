# Movie API Search Tool

Uses The Movie Database API, IMBD, YouTube, and Wikipdia API's to look up information about a movie that you may want to watch

## To install and run

- Create a [IMBD API key](https://imdb-api.com).
- Create a [Movie Database API key]
- Create an environment variable **YOUTUBE_API_KEY** holding your key.

- To utilize API keys, you will need to create a .env file in your main directory. You will not be able to upload it to this repo as most .gitignore will ignore the file. This is for security reasons as you do not want to post your API Keys to these services out in the open. When you are done creating the .env file, insert your respective keys into the text below and then save the .env file.

```

export MOVIE_API_KEY='INSERT MOVIE_API_KEY KEY HERE'
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY='INSERT YOUTUBE_API_KEY AUTH_TOKEN KEY HERE'


```

App will be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
